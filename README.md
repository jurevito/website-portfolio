# Personal Portfolio Website
Repository for personal portfolio website using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a **personal portfolio website** that uses 3D models and animations to make it more visually appealing. I would like to have at least one hand animated model on the website and a few static models which react to user movements (scrolling or moving a mouse). I will use following tutorials as inspiration and guidance:
- [Build a Mindblowing 3D Portfolio Website - FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU)
- [Create a Room Portfolio with Three.js and Blender -

## Technologies
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/): a framework for building a website.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): library for rendering 3D models in browser.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/): 3D modeling software for modeling, animation and texturing.

## Foreseen difficulties
There will definitely be a lot of difficulties, but it is hard for me to foresee them. I will spend a lot of time figuring how to write code for frontend and how to style a page using CSS since I don't have that much experience with it. I am pretty confident in my ability to make low poly models and texture them, but animation could pose a problem.

## Milestones
### Milestone 1 (27.02)
1. Create a rough outline of a website without styling.
2. Render a simple 3D object with texture on it.
### Milestone 2 (13.03)
### Milestone 3 (27.03)
### Milestone 4 (10.04)
### Milestone 5 (24.04)
### Milestone 6 (08.05)
