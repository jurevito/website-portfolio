Notes:
[ ] Make layout wider.
[ ] Make 3D models bigger because animations are not that noticable. Increase max height.
[ ] Make project images bigger, personal portfolio picture is cursed.
[ ] Make font larger on extra large screen.
[ ] Make rotation more noticable.
[ ] Some indication that the models are clickable.
[ ] Under yt2mp3 project, write a problem statement/pain point.
[ ] Experience section is too small. Possible solutions are adding education with it, joining contact and experience section into CV.
[ ] Join house models in giant scene to improve render calls. (Premature optimization?)
[ ] When clicking on picture open github. And display hover.
[ ] Change opacity of sections that are not in the middle of the screen. (Focus)
